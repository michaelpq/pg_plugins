pg_trunc2del
============

This extension replaces any TRUNCATE statement by an equivalent DELETE
statement on-the-fly and executes it. This extension has some caveats
though but for the purpose of the demonstration that is thought as
acceptable:
- TRUNCATE triggers are not fired.
- DELETE triggers defined on the relation would be fired.
- Nothing is done to emulate an equivalent of TRUNCATE CASCADE.

Not really recommended for production purposes, this is aimed at
demonstrating how to dynamically switch SQL queries sent to PostgreSQL
transparently.
