pg_plugins, set of plugin templates for PostgreSQL
==================================================

This repository contains a collection of plug-ins for PostgreSQL that can
be used as templates for more extensive work, like:

- Custom background workers that have been introduced in PostgreSQL 9.3
- Logical decoding plug-ins
- Custom logging formats
- Containers
- Hook examples with custom logs
- Extensions
- Table access methods
- etc.

Installation
------------

Simply run the following command with pg_config in PATH:

    make install

All the subcommands of PGXS are available as well. Note that some modules
may fail to compile because of missing dependencies or a version of
PostgreSQL code incompatible with the module. You may want to compile
individually modules if that is the case. In all cases each plugin is
maintained to be compatible with the latest version of PostgreSQL.
