jsonlog, logs in JSON format for PostgreSQL
===========================================

This module is a logging facility using the hook present in elog.c to
generate server logs in JSON format.

Its installation can be done by adding this parameter in postgresql.conf:

    shared_preload_libraries = 'jsonlog'

Note that logging_collector should be enabled in postgresql.conf to
ensure consistent log outputs.  As JSON strings are longer than normal
logs generated by PostgreSQL, this module increases the odds of malformed
log entries.
