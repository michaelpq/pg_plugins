hello_notify, custom bgworker for PostgreSQL
================================================================================
Small bgworker presenting how to manage send-out notifications for queries
taking a too long time to run. This worker uses a simply method based on
pg_notify to initialize a channel that can be listened by the other backends.

This worker can use the following parameters:
- hello_notify.database, the database to send notification messages to.
  This cannot change after server startup.
- hello_notify.channel_name, name of the channel initialized by the worker.
  Can be reloaded with SIGHUP.
- hello_notify.nap_time, internal of time in seconds between which NOTIFY
  messages are sent. Can be reloaded with SIGHUP. This also represents the
  amount of time to check.

Backends that want to listen to this worker need to connect to the database
defined by hello_notify.database and LISTEN to the channel defined by
hello_notify.channel_name.

Another important thing to remember when using NOTIFY with background workers
is to call ProcessCompletedNotifies after the transaction that sent the NOTIFY
messages commits.
